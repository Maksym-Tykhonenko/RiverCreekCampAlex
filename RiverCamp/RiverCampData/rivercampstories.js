    rivercampdescr: `The first night at River Creek was colder than we expected. The fire cracked lazily, and the mist rolled in from the water thick as milk. By midnight, most of us were half asleep, wrapped in blankets, when we heard it — a single, clear whistle coming from the riverbank.
It wasn’t a bird. It wasn’t the wind. It was deliberate — two short notes, one long. Almost like someone calling a dog. No one said a word, but I saw Kevin rise, flashlight trembling in his hand. He grinned like it was some prank. “Probably the guys from Site B,” he muttered and started walking toward the sound.
The whistle came again — closer this time, lower, and somehow… wetter. Kevin stopped, turned his light toward the trees, and called out. The sound stopped instantly. A ripple spread across the dark surface of the water, though there was no wind at all.
We heard footsteps after that, crunching through the gravel, but they weren’t moving away — they circled. We shouted his name, but only the river answered, slow and quiet. The flashlight beam flickered once between the trees and went out.
By morning, there was nothing. His sleeping bag was neatly folded. Near the water, we found wet footprints leading into the creek — and another set leading back, smaller ones, stopping just at the edge of camp.
That night, at the same hour, the whistle came again. Two short, one long. And this time… I swear it came from inside our tent.`,

    rivercampdescr: `We set up camp on the second ridge above the river, far from the others. It was quiet, the air heavy with pine and smoke. Just before sleep, we counted: six tents, six campers. The night was clear. The forest breathed slow.
But at sunrise, there were seven tents. A small, grey one, right between mine and Nora’s. The fabric was damp, zipped shut. None of us had heard a thing, not a single step or voice.
Nora called out, “Who’s there?” No answer. She unzipped the flap halfway — inside, only a single lantern, still warm, and a pile of river stones stacked like a small cairn. The stones smelled of algae.
We waited all morning, thinking someone had wandered off. No one came. Around noon, we packed up to move downriver, but when I turned for one last look, the grey tent was gone.
That night, the same lantern appeared by our fire. It flickered once, as if someone had just set it down.`,

    rivercampdescr: `They say River Creek was once home to an old cabin, long gone now. We found what was left of it — just a chimney and something nailed to a tree beside it: a cracked mirror.
We laughed, of course. “Seven years bad luck,” someone joked. But when Emma looked inside, she froze. “It’s me,” she whispered, “but older… and wet.”
We all peered in, one after another. My reflection blinked slower than I did. Kevin’s grinned when he wasn’t smiling. Emma wouldn’t speak after that. She just turned the mirror face down.
That night, she woke screaming. Said she saw her reflection standing at the riverbank, staring back at her, dripping. By morning, the mirror was gone. But the nail in the tree — it was bent outward, like something had pulled hard from the inside.`,

    rivercampdescr: `The forest floor was soft, covered in pine needles. Perfect for sneaking up on someone. Around midnight, I heard the crunch — slow, deliberate, circling our fire.
I thought it was deer. But the steps were too even, too light. Then I noticed the marshmallows on a stick by the fire — the top one missing. Just… gone.
The steps came again, closer, almost playful. I held my breath and shone my flashlight. Nothing but the outlines of our bags and boots. Then something giggled.
At dawn, we found handprints in the ashes — tiny ones, like a child’s. They led out into the woods and stopped near the river, where the mud was too thin to hold another print.
When I looked closer, I saw something small pressed in the soil — a little round button. It was still warm.`,

    rivercampdescr: `Fog covered the creek that night, thick and glowing from the campfire. Through it, we saw her — a faint light moving between the trees. A lantern, swinging gently.
We called out, thinking she was lost. The light paused, then turned toward us, but no one answered. I swear I heard humming, soft and broken, like a lullaby.
She walked along the water’s edge, and we followed — just until we saw the footprints. Small ones, barefoot, leading one way. No return prints.
We went back to camp, shaken but laughing it off. Yet when I crawled into my tent later, the air smelled like wet hair and candle smoke. And on my pillow lay a single wet footprint, perfectly shaped.`,

    rivercampdescr: `Owen brought an old camping radio — one with a crank handle. It only caught static, but he liked to turn it on before bed, said it felt “safe.”
That night, the static began to pulse, almost rhythmic, and beneath it came a whisper — too faint to make out. He leaned closer, turning the dial. The whisper repeated, louder this time: “Owen.”
He laughed nervously, said it was interference. But the next night, it said my name. Then Nora’s. By the third night, it didn’t need the radio — we heard it outside the tent, breathing the same words.
We smashed the radio to pieces and threw it into the creek. It hissed as it sank, like it was still alive. But when the wind blew through camp that night, it carried that same pulse — crackling, calling each of us, one by one.`,

    rivercampdescr: `At the base of the hill stood a half-buried statue — a weathered face with empty eyes, moss creeping across the lips. We joked that it was our “camp guardian.”
But the longer we stayed, the more it seemed to shift. At first, the mouth looked closed. Then half open. Then wide enough to swallow the light.
On the fourth night, I woke to the sound of grinding stone. The statue was facing our campfire. No one had touched it. Its mouth was smiling.
In the morning, we found stones arranged around it — five perfect circles, one for each of us. Inside mine was my name, carved deep into the dirt.`,

    rivercampdescr: `The rain started after midnight. I couldn’t sleep. Then I heard breathing — not mine, not anyone’s from inside. It was just outside the tent flap, slow and steady.
I thought maybe it was wind, until I saw the outline — a hand pressing against the fabric. Then it slid upward, stopped near my face. I didn’t move.
I whispered to Nora. She didn’t answer. Her sleeping bag was empty.
When the sun came up, the ground outside was soaked, but there were no footprints. Only a long drag mark leading toward the creek. Her sleeping bag was wet inside — and smelled like the river.`,

    rivercampdescr: `We found a hollow log big enough to crawl through. When we shouted into it, it echoed — except for one word: our names. No matter who tried, silence.
That night, we dared each other to say them again. Emma leaned close, whispered hers. The echo came back twisted — the same name, but… wrong. Like something was learning it.
The next morning, she wasn’t there. Just her backpack near the log, and inside — a note. “Stop saying it.”
We burned the log. The smoke smelled like damp hair and pine. But through the crackle of fire, I swear I heard the echo again — saying my name, perfectly.`,

    rivercampdescr: `We stayed for the last night, even though the others wanted to leave. The fire burned low, blue at the base, and the trees were whispering like waves.
We decided to tell one final story — the same one, together. Every detail we’d seen, every strange thing that happened. As we spoke, the air grew colder, and the shadows around the fire leaned in.
When I looked up, there were faces in the smoke — small, flickering, familiar. The girl, the statue, even the footprints. They weren’t stories anymore; they were listening.
The fire popped once, and the blue turned white. I don’t remember falling asleep, only waking up to daylight and silence. The tents were gone, the ashes cold.
But on the ground, in the soot, ten handprints were pressed in a perfect circle. Mine was still warm.`,
